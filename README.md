# Where's Wally
A year 2 Computer Science assignment to find an a reference image inside of a larger image, in this case it was wally inside of a cluttered scene.
Though the code presented here is designed to be universal and thus should find best candidates for any other data set though better difference measures may need to be implemented.

## Usage
- Clone the repo.
- Compile and then just run the excutable and pass the paths to your images. (Currently only supports a weird text based format that was given for the assesment.)
- View the executables folder for the outputted image and read the consoles comandline for the top n candidates. The best candidate location should be outlined in the exported image.
